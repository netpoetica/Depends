# Depends
## Simple cli for including common JavaScript libraries and/or a defined project structure

This started off as a quick diddy, but I'm seeing some major additions to it in the future. Currently it only includes:
- Zepto
- Underscore
- Backbone

Also, it's a very defined structure right now (lots of ideas there, too).

### Create

```
$> depends create
```

Create will initialize your project structure, prompt you on libraries you want to use, and create your index.html file.

### Libs

```
$> depends libs
```

Libs will prompt you on the libraries you want to include.
